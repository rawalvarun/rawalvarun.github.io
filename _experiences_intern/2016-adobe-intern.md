* Actively participated in and contributed to the fulfilment of the Project based on \Analytics of Multi-Channel
Customer Data"
* Applied Machine Learning models to predict customer affinity to interact in a given channel with limited
information, given this information of interaction across other channels.
* Designed a unique and novel solution approach exploiting CCA (Canonical Correlation Analysis) for suggesting
ways for predicting customers' purchase behavior using a shared feature space which captures cross channel
correlations instead of directly merging the input channels' data or predicting on the basis of single channel.
