IEEE 802.11ac supports Dynamic Bandwidth Channel Access (DBCA), where a wireless station selects
channel bandwidth dynamically based on the availability of the secondary channels. But the widely-used
contention based medium access mechanism provides an opportunistic access of secondary channels and
affects the performance of DBCA. Consequently, unfairness in channel access is increased in DBCA,
which further reduces average throughput of stations. In this work, we develop a hybrid adaptive resource
reservation mechanism, Hybrid Adaptive DBCA (HA-DBCA), for supporting fair channel access in
DBCA. In HA-DBCA, a polling based online learning mechanism is designed to avoid starvation of
primary channel users. This work has been accepted for publication in IEEE Conference on Local
Computer Networks (LCN) 2017.
